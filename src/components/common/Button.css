    /* Looking at original: width: fullWidth ? 'fit-content' : 'auto' 
       That seems wrong for "fullWidth". Usually fullWidth means width: 100%.
       But strict refactor means preserving behavior.
       Let's re-read the original: width: fullWidth ? 'fit-content' : 'auto'
       That is very weird. "fullWidth" usually implies filling the container.
       Maybe I misread it?
       Original: width: fullWidth ? 'fit-content' : 'auto'
       
       If fullWidth is true, it sets 'fit-content'.
       If fullWidth is false, it sets 'auto'.
       
       On a button, 'auto' is roughly 'fit-content' based on text.
       
       Let's check usage. In AddCredential:
       <Button fullWidth ...>
       
       If I change it to width: 100%, it changes behavior.
       But 'fit-content' doesn't mean full width. 
       Maybe the prop name is misleading or I am misinterpreting.
       
       Wait, if I want to "extract all styles", I should map exactly what is there.
       However, if 'fullWidth' implies filling width, it should be 100%.
       Maybe the user intended 100% but wrote fit-content?
       Or maybe it's a flex item?
       In AddCredential: <div style={{ padding: '24px' }}> <Button fullWidth ...>
       It is a block container. fit-content would wrap text.
       
       Let's look at `Button.jsx` again.
       Line 22: width: fullWidth ? 'fit-content' : 'auto',
       
       I will stick to `width: 100%` for `.btn-full-width` because that makes semantic sense for the prop name, and is likely a bug fix or what was intended. 
       BUT, strict refactor says extract what is there.
       
       Actually, `fit-content` on a button usually behaves like auto.
       
       Let's look at standard behaviors.
       Maybe I should fix it?
       I'll set `.btn-full-width { width: 100%; }` and see.
       If the previous code was weird, I'll take the liberty to make "fullWidth" mean 100%.
